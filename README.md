# Senior-Research-Project-2022-2023
This repository includes the MATLAB codes used in my senior research project (SRP) entitled "On a Generalization of Kernel RLS to Nonlinear State-space Systems".

The repo consists of four different folders, where each folder contains the files of a different algorithm. 

Paper can be accessed from [the following link](https://github.com/7mxd/Senior-Research-Project-2022-2023/blob/41ec5ad983444fac74547b666517552bd850dc9b/SRP_FINAL_49714.pdf).
