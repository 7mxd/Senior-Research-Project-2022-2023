# Senior-Research-Project-2022-2023
This repository includes the MATLAB codes used in my senior research project (SRP) entitled "On a Generalization of Kernel RLS to Nonlinear State-space Systems".

The repo consists of four different folders, where each folder contains the files of a different algorithm. 

1. [`ARMA Learning Algorithm`](https://github.com/7mxd/Senior-Research-Project-2022-2023/tree/9e0e51acb88fab92d44ea3514b96429b77768020/ARMA%20Learning%20Algorithm) contains the files related the Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) algorithm, which is addressed through **pages 4&mdash;10** of the paper.

2. [`LS Algorithm`](https://github.com/7mxd/Senior-Research-Project-2022-2023/tree/87328746101959fbf58dafeacc4a828ffdfbeec8/LS%20Algorithm) contains the files related the Least Squares (LS) algorithm, which is addressed through **pages 11&mdash;13** of the paper.

3. [`RLS Algorithm`](https://github.com/7mxd/Senior-Research-Project-2022-2023/tree/87328746101959fbf58dafeacc4a828ffdfbeec8/RLS%20Algorithm) contains the files related the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm, which is addressed through **pages 13&mdash;16** of the paper.

4. [`KRLS Algorithm`](https://github.com/7mxd/Senior-Research-Project-2022-2023/tree/25d2428e19e0ce8601dcddaae516a9ed53f98194/KRLS%20Algorithm) contains the files related the Kernel Recursive Least Squares (KRLS) algorithm, which is addressed through **pages 16&mdash;21** of the paper.
